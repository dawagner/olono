OloNO README . OloNO is Not an Othello
--------------------------------------
this looks like an FAQ but it isn't ...

+ Where does OloNO come from ?
------------------------------
It started as a student project in ISEP 2008-2009Â©


+ What is OloNo ?
-----------------
Despite the retro acronym and all the Magritte's painting
OloNO is an Othello game.


+ I just recieved the package, how do I run it ?
------------------------------------------------
I guess you are willing to compile and install OloNO.
You will find basic instructions about the process in the
INSTALL file.
But before you do so, you might want to consider this :
let's say you just received this package, you may proceed
to the install.

To cut a long story short :
  $ ./configure --prefix=YOURDIR
  $ make
  $ make install

NOTE : if YOURDIR doesn't belong to your user, then you will
need to run make install as root. (using su, sudo, ...)


+ What is AUTO.sh
-----------------
AUTO.sh is a little homemade script that runs the autotools.
You don't need that if you just want to build and execute the program.
See section "How do I run it ?"


Have a nice day.
